# OnlineGoServer

The goal of this server is to create some fun mini games of Go for others to enjoy. In addition to this, I am hoping to make it very beginner friendly. Thus, we are first starting out with Capture Go and will go from there.

Ideas I would like to implement in the future...

Territory Go
Blind Go
One color Go
Three Color Go
Four Color Go
Bomb Go
Rengo
3v3 Go
4v4 Go
Achievements
Tsumego
Tsumego Challenges and time trials

Lots of fun stuff, but I'm taking it one at a time. :)
